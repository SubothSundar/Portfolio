# Portfolio
WebProgramming lab assessment-6
The Portfolio I have developed is a proof of my abilities and the unique way to showcase my work and let others know about myself. Also, it serves as a platform to display my work and demonstrate my skills. In this assignment, I have used HTML and CSS to create a website portfolio. It contains different sections like â€œIntroduction to Myself, About me, Skills, Contact Details.
